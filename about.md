Hi, I am Nikant. I'm a software engineer with a knack for entrepreneurship. I design, build, and ship software that makes the world a better place.I am currently working as a part of PayPal Research Labs. Our team works with a motto to create a dent in the universe by creating products that our customers love.

I am interested in all aspects of Product Development starting from idea conception to market research to developing prototypes and converting them into full fledged products. I have worked in the past into creating products in diverse areas ranging from fun apps to hardware based solutions.

I am quite well versed in iOS app development and have previous experience in developing Android apps and Java Rest services. I love contributing to open source and have been a part of Google Summer of Code program in the past.
