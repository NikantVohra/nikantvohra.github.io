Hi, I am Nikant. I work as a Product developer at PayPal. I love to write Software that can make impact on millions of people around the world.

I am interested in all aspects of Product Development starting from idea conception to market research to developing prototypes and converting them into full fledged products. I have worked in the past into creating products in diverse areas ranging from fun apps to hardware based solutions.

I am currently trying my hands on iOS development and have developed various apps in the past one year.This blog will mostly have posts about my experiences in software design and development.
